# 🎓 Pass or Fail

A simple Python script that helps determine whether students pass or fail based on their marks. 🚦

💡 What It Does

- Takes marks (0–100) for **5 students**
- Prints "Pass" if a student's mark is **50 or above**
- Prints "Fail" if the mark is **below 50**
- Counts and displays the total number of students who passed

💡 Why I made this
-Just practicing basic Python logic — if/else statements, loops, and input/output — all wrapped in a beginner-friendly exercise.
